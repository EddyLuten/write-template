# write-template

A project template to write prose in Visual Studio Code (yes, really). Compilation steps are kicked off through GitHub Actions (see the `.github` directory for details).

## Project Structure

Chapters are stored as individual Markdown files in the `chapters` directory.

Research is in the `research` directory.

## EPUB Compilation

During compilation, files are read from the file system in order, so maintain a sort-friendly filename system. I recommend prefixing a chapter number to the filename for fiction, or an ISO-8601 type date format for journaling, e.g.:

- `001-chapter-name.md`
- `2020-09-20-journal.md`
- `2020-journal.md`

If you prefer to maintain a custom file/chapter order, you can modify the `scripts/compile.js` file to your liking.

## EPUB Metadata

The file `chapters/metadata.yaml` is a YAML file containing the metadata for the EPUB file generated by the compilation script. The provided file is a minimum viable sample file. However, for real projects, I suggest reading [the Pandoc documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#epub-metadata) for this specific file since you will want to customize this.
